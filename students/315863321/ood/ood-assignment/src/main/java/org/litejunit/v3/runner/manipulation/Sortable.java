 * Interface for runners that allow sorting of tests. By sorting tests based on when they last failed, most recently
 * failed first, you can reduce the average time to the first test failing. Test sorting should not be used to
 * cope with order dependencies between tests. Tests that are isolated from each other are less
 * expensive to maintain and can be run individually.
