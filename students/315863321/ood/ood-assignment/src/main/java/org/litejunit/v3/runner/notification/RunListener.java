/**
 * If you need to respond to the events during a test run, extend <code>RunListener</code>
 * and override the appropriate methods. If a listener throws an exception while processing a 
 * test event, it will be removed for the remainder of the test run.
 * <p>
 * For example, suppose you have a <code>Cowbell</code>
 * class that you want to make a noise whenever a test fails. You could write:<br>
 * <code>
 * public class RingingListener extends RunListener {
 * %nbsp;%nbsp;public void testFailure(Failure failure) {
 * %nbsp;%nbsp;%nbsp;%nbsp;Cowbell.ring();
 * %nbsp;%nbsp;}
 * }
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * To invoke your listener, you need to run your tests through <code>JUnitCore</code>. <br>
 * <code>
 * public void main(String... args) {
 * %nbsp;%nbsp;JUnitCore core= new JUnitCore();
 * %nbsp;%nbsp;core.addListener(new RingingListener());
 * %nbsp;%nbsp;
 * core.run(MyTestClass.class);
 * }
 * </code>
 * @see JUnitCore
